(1) Run Wrapper.m
(2) Change ColorSpace by changing ColorSpace variable to any one of RGB or YCbCr or yRb. The code thresholds currently work for YCbCr.
(3) To train, Set TrainFlag = 1, switched off by default. Not easy to train as I have trained it for selected 41 images, for any queries do contact me. Sorry for the inconvinience.
(4) Any questions or problems contact me at nitinsan@seas.upenn.edu (Nitin J. Sanket).
